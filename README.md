# AI_Code_Analyzer_and_Reviwer
The objective of this project is to develop a Python application that allows users to submit their Python code for review and receive feedback on potential bugs along with suggestions for fixes. The application should be user-friendly, efficient, and provide accurate bug reports and fixed code snippets.
The AI Code Analyzer and Reviewer is an intelligent tool designed to analyze, review, and improve source code automatically. It leverages artificial intelligence to detect syntax errors, logical issues, security vulnerabilities, and code inefficiencies while providing meaningful recommendations for optimization and best practices.
#User Interface:
The application have a clean and intuitive user interface built using Streamlit.
Users should be able to easily input their Python code into the application.

#To run the code for this particular file, run the following command which is given below:
""streamlit run File_name.py""
